  "methodology": "\nThis website runs the Single Transferable Vote (STV) using Meek's method using Droop quota, a precise and widely recognized algorithm for proportional ranked-choice elections.\nThis is the same type of method used in various real-world governmental and organizational elections.\n\nThe underlying algorithm is implemented in open source by Guillaume Endignoux, an engineer at Google.\nIt can be found [here](https://github.com/gendx/stv-rs) and explained [here](https://gendignoux.com/blog/2023/03/27/single-transferable-vote.html).\n\nBy default, STV selects a set of winners, but does not provide a strict ranking of those elected.\nTo provide a podium-style order, this website augments the STV results by ranking the elected candidates using [Copeland's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland%27s_method),\na well-known approach based on pairwise comparison of preferences across all ballots.\nSpecifically, candidates are first selected by STV, and then their order is determined according to voter preferences using Copeland's method.\n",
